# Discrete-Event-Simulator
Java
Created and implemented a software that simulates a system with events, states, servers and customers, like a restaurant.
Discrete: states remain unchanged between two events, and the simulator can jump from one event to another.
Events occurs at a particular time, and each event alters the states of the system and may generate more events.
Simulator: tracks statistics to measure the performance.
